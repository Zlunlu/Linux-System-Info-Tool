# Linux System Info Tool
Wrote this Script for work to get system info from various servers because you never really know the hardware's capabilities and configuration. Having a script to find it out just expedites the process.

This script makes no changes to your device. It only gives you the system info.

I've tested it on Debian Distro's and Fedora but I tried to make it as compatible with all distro's as possible.
Insert USB drive with script on it.

open terminal and run

/path/to/script/LinuxSysteminfo.sh

OR

Copy script to desktop

cd ~/Desktop/

./LinuxSysteminfo.sh

Side note:
If you have the setting enabled you can make it execuatble and you can click on it and run it from the file system.
It will keep the terminal window open until you press enter or close the window.
